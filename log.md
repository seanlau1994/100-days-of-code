Day 1ï¼š Oct 20th, 2021

Today's progress: Finished Applied Accessbility on FCC

Thoughts: I understand some basic concept of accessbility refers to webcontent and UI.I thought I got the image and a roughly idea now, still need more study and practice to improve.

Today's progress: Finished Responsive Web Design Principles && CSS Flexbox on FCC

Day 3: Oct 22th, 2021

Today's progress: Finished the GSS Grid Section and my first project [Tribute Page](https://codepen.io/seanlau1994/full/GRvNvPe)

Thoughts: Just followed the instruction step by step to build the projects side, I did found that I do stil need a lots practice to enhance the knowledge. Stucked for a while to set the ul in the middle of the page, checked the demo page and found that I thought too far away, the basic css properties can make it. Anyway it is a good day and good practice, I spents about 3 - 4 hours on coding today. Keep it going ~

Day 4: Oct 23th, 2021

Today's progress: Working on the second projects 

Thoughts: I really messed everything up at first, I was trying to work on both html content and css file together to make it have a similar looking as the demo project. I realise that i am totally wrong and delete all the css I did and fisnished the html parts. I got more ideas about when I should use a div to wrap my contents in and also recapped the knowledge about how to make a radio, checkbox and select in the html.

Day 5: Oct 24th, 2021

Today's progress: Some CSS work and researching

Thoughts: Many skills I am still not able to use them in the real project, working on the css today and did many research and now I am more understand the different between border-box and content-box and why I want to use them, also the difference between em and rem. Recap the position properties I thought I still need learn more about where or in which senarios I should apply them. 

Day 6: Oct 25th, 2021

Today's progress: adding some css to the container div and form of my project

Thoughts: The main thing I was focus on today is try to add line break to different labels and inputs element in the form. The demo projects is using display:flex, but seems the radio options still list in row. I assumed it has been fixed somewhere in the later css properties. I did some research and used display:block for my label element. 

Day 7: Oct 26th, 2021

Today's progress: finished my second projects [Survey Form](https://codepen.io/seanlau1994/pen/Badpypq?editors=1100), lots research and many hours work for a eazy projects

Thoughts: I am really happy at the moment when I get the code done. I did many research and try to understand why should I do this and how can I use the code. 
correct the decision I made yesterday and change the display block to flex. Now I have more understanding about the media queries to make the webpage responsive and how "class" work between html and css. 

Day 8: Oct 27th, 2021

Today's progress: working on the landing page project's html part.

Thoughts: I can code the simple contents as user story required but still lack experience about Semantics. For instance when and where to use <section> <article> not only use div for everything. Where to use <div> to make a new line not only use "<br>".
