Thoughts: Just followed the instruction step by step to build the projects side, I did found that I do stil need a lots practice to enhance the knowledge. Stucked for a while to set the ul in the middle of the page, checked the demo page and found that I thought too far away, the basic css properties can make it. Anyway it is a good day and good practice, I spents about 3 - 4 hours on coding today. Keep it going ~
