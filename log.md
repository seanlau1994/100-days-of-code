Day 1ï¼š Oct 20th, 2021

Day 3: Oct 22th, 2021

Today's progress: Finished the GSS Grid Section and my first project [Tribute Page](https://codepen.io/seanlau1994/full/GRvNvPe)

Thoughts: Just followed the instruction step by step to build the projects side, I did found that I do stil need a lots practice to enhance the knowledge. Stucked for a while to set the ul in the middle of the page, checked the demo page and found that I thought too far away, the basic css properties can make it. Anyway it is a good day and good practice, I spents about 3 - 4 hours on coding today. Keep it going ~

Day 4: Oct 23th, 2021

Today's progress: Working on the second projects 

Thoughts: I really messed everything up at first, I was trying to work on both html content and css file together to make it have a similar looking as the demo project. I realise that i am totally wrong and delete all the css I did and fisnished the html parts. I got more ideas about when I should use a div to wrap my contents in and also recapped the knowledge about how to make a radio, checkbox and select in the html.

Day 5: Oct 24th, 2021

Today's progress: Some CSS work and researching

Thoughts: Many skills I am still not able to use them in the real project, working on the css today and did many research and now I am more understand the different between border-box and content-box and why I want to use them, also the difference between em and rem. Recap the position properties I thought I still need learn more about where or in which senarios I should apply them. 

Day 6: Oct 25th, 2021

Today's progress: adding some css to the container div and form of my project

Thoughts: The main thing I was focus on today is try to add line break to different labels and inputs element in the form. The demo projects is using display:flex, but seems the radio options still list in row. I assumed it has been fixed somewhere in the later css properties. I did some research and used display:block for my label element. 

Day 7: Oct 26th, 2021

Today's progress: finished my second projects [Survey Form](https://codepen.io/seanlau1994/pen/Badpypq?editors=1100), lots research and many hours work for a eazy projects

Thoughts: I am really happy at the moment when I get the code done. I did many research and try to understand why should I do this and how can I use the code. 
correct the decision I made yesterday and change the display block to flex. Now I have more understanding about the media queries to make the webpage responsive and how "class" work between html and css. 

Day 8: Oct 27th, 2021

Today's progress: working on the landing page project's html part.

Thoughts: I can code the simple contents as user story required but still lack experience about Semantics. For instance when and where to use section article not only use div for everything. Where to use div to make a new line not only use br. 

Day 9: Oct 28th, 2021

Today's progress: finished the html file and parts of css.

Day 11: Oct 30th, 2021

Today's progress: I am working for my 4th project today 

Day 12: Oct 31th, 2021

Today's progress: Working on my 4th project. 

Thoughts: I gain more experience by trying to code the projects, such as use overflow: hidden and declare the height or width to make the container to the size I want. Also, the if I use position: absolute, I can use the margin-left to make it in the right place, not under my sidebar or if user scroll horizontally my main contents move to left side underneath the sidebar.  

Day 13: Nov 1st, 2021

Today's progress: working on my 4th project

Day 14: Nov 2nd, 2021

Today's progress: finished my 4th project [Technical Documentation Page](https://codepen.io/seanlau1994/pen/eYEExda?editors=1100)

Thoughts: I got some problem regards the media query, my solution stops responsive once the page width less than 380px, but the demo one is about 280px. Maybe the problem is from I am using rem not px? or missing some properties ?
